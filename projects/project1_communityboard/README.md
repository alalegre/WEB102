## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Since it's been a while that I've done web design, it took me a while to figure out how to
  use flex display and how to display the cards in a grid format. I used previous projects as
  a reference

- Not really a challenge, but I wanted to copy the card style of the example given to us. I used the prework code
  as the base code and style of the card. In my card, there were padding around the image which I didn't want. I
  managed to fix it by removing the padding.
